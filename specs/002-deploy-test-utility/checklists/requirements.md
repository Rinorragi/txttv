# Specification Quality Checklist: Simple Deployment & WAF Testing Utility

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: February 7, 2026
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Initial Review (February 7, 2026)**:
- All checklist items pass
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and testable
- User stories are properly prioritized (P1-P5) with independent test criteria
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases cover common failure scenarios
- Assumptions and dependencies are documented
- Out of scope section clearly defines boundaries

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
